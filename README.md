# EYE-FOR-AN-EYE
## 2025 Tritonware October VGDC @ UCSD Project. This is a Java-based, dice rolling casino-style video game.
### WARNING: CONTAINS SPIDERS AND VARIOUS INSECTS!

This project was made during a game jam at UCSD. It was personally my (James') first video game ever developed. Special thanks to Matthew Cho for helping with the programming side of things, Etta for the amazing SFX and BGM, and Jane and Robyn for being outstanding artists!
